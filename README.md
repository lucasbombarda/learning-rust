# Learning Rust
This space is dedicated to documenting my progress and projects as I dive deep into the world of Rust programming. As a self-taught coder transitioning into Rust, my aim is to build a comprehensive portfolio of projects that showcase my understanding and application of Rust concepts.

## Setup
Ensure Rust and Cargo is installed.

## Usage
1. Clone the repo:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/lucasbombarda/learning-rust
```

2. Simple run any Rust file inside src/ using cargo:
```bash
cargo run --bin sorts
```
